I would love to apply my experience to work in your team.
I have a passion for cutting edge technology and would love to work to develop websites
and applications. In my free time and Whilst completing a 12 week web development bootcamp
with Bath Spa University I have been creating websites
using <b>html,</b> <b>css</b> and <b>javascript.</b> Prior to completion of 
my course I have had years of experience in customer service, hospitality roles and 
as an electrician by trade.
